Product offers or recommendations that appear on the home page, product information page, and cart page are a form of
personalized marketing designed to improve user experience and increase sales.

Products are recommended based on a user's previews and purchases, as well as other factors such as product popularity,
product ratings and reviews, and the user's location. The recommendation algorithm takes into account a user's search
history, products viewed and purchase history, as well as the search and purchase behavior of other users to suggest
relevant and personalized products.

Product recommendations are displayed in different sections, such as Products You May Like, Products Related to Your
Search, Products You've Recently Viewed, and more. These sections may vary depending on the page and user behavior.

Product recommendations are generated using machine learning algorithms that analyze large amounts of user data to
provide personalized recommendations. Algorithms learn from historical user data, product attributes and other factors
to predict user preferences and suggest the most relevant products.

Recommendations aim to increase user engagement and loyalty by providing a personalized shopping experience that meets
their needs and preferences. By offering products that are most likely to interest the user, the platform increases the
chances of a successful sale.

In general, product recommendations are an important part of the platform's personalized marketing strategy aimed at
improving user interaction, increasing sales and building customer loyalty.
