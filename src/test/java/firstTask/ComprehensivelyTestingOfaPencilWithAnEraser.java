1) Functional testing: Write on paper with a pencil and erase with an eraser to make sure that both functions
work correctly: the pencil writes and the eraser erases without leaving a mark.


2) Usability Test: Test the ease of use of the pencil and eraser in the hand, their weight, size, ease of use
and ability to erase mistakes with the eraser without leaving marks or damaging the paper.


3) Compatibility Check: Check the pencil and eraser to ensure compatibility with different types of paper and writing
surfaces. This test will help determine whether the pencil and eraser work correctly on different types of paper or
surfaces, such as glossy or textured paper.


4) Stress test: Test the pencil and eraser under extreme conditions. This test involves exposing the product to extremes
of temperature, humidity and other environmental factors to determine how it performs under adverse conditions.


5) Performance testing: Check whether the pencil with eraser can work with additional load. This test can be performed,
for example, by pressing the pencil with an eraser with more force than before, or by trying to erase more lines at once.


6) Load testing: Test the pencil and eraser for strength. This test involves applying varying degrees of
pressure to an eraser and a pencil to determine their resistance to wear. It also involves testing the eraser's ability
to withstand repeated use without degradation.

materials or substances that may be present in the product, as well as checking for any potential choking hazards
for children.
